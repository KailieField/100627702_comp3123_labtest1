Hello Professor!
Welcome to my Lab Test 01 Repository.

Believe it or not, 
I spent most of my day working on this and tried to make it as concise as possible,
perhaps I spent too much time but although it needs work, and I was able to deliver on most of the knowledge,
there are holes in that understanding that became very apparent. 

On that note: 
It's appreciated that you provided documentation for us to refer to as this came in handy. 

As you can tell Question 3 has more potential than what I was able to do -- merely the skeleton.
I wanted to turn this into an async function and add error handling, but I began to run out of time,
and as I was completing the logic, at my first available moment in completeing the baseline, I moved on -- I spent too much time on this and that is because
of the lack in my knowledge.

I also had some nervousness come on when I was being told by my IDE that I needed to include sync with different ways of addressing directories, reading files etc.
I didnt know what to do anymore so I just kept this suggestion -- it worked so, I kept what was working for me -- again time.  

I had intentions of turning the first question into a menu of sorts -- but again, the logic escaped me during the test and I
didnt want to waste more time -- you will see evidence of this. 

Please feel free to peruse my comments, I tend to break down the questions into stages and parts,
this helps me understand what it is that I am doing and mentally check off deliverable requirements along the way.

You will see multiple reformatting commits that reflect this pattern of mine as I complete code along the way. 


Thank you very much for this lab test 1, 
I have been able to recognize that a lot of my knowledge needs to be more solidified...there are holes in my understanding for certain.  
I spend too much time on formatting, syntax and sometimes details that are irrelevant showing me that my code is decent in many areas, 
but I need to work on integrating more knowledge. 

I know know what I need to focus on moving forward. 

Thank you very much once more and I look forward to your feedback!

Warm regards,
Kailie
